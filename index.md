In this case study from Data Analytics Accelerator, I was promoted to analyst World Bank data for the IDA which provides loans to developing country's. The main focus was understading how to use SQL to parse out the data needed to gain insights into which countries; receive the most loans, which countries repay loans fastes and more. 



### [SQL Healthcare Project](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/you-important-healthcare-project-using-sql-ian-steffensen-mba/)
[<img src="images/SQL Healthcare Project.png?raw=true"/>](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/you-important-healthcare-project-using-sql-ian-steffensen-mba/)
This project we focus our efforts in SQL using two data bases to pull in Patient health information and Patient demographic information. We used fuctions such as INNERJOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, UNION, SUBQUERY and CONCAT to disect insights from the data. Had a great time trying my hand at SQL and look forward to using SQL on a more regular basis.


### [2022-2023 NBA season player analysis](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/2022-2023-nba-season-player-analysis-ian-steffensen-mba/)
[<img src="images/Basketball image.png?raw=true"/>](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/2022-2023-nba-season-player-analysis-ian-steffensen-mba/)
In this project I pulled all player stats from the 2022-2023 NBA season. I wanted to understand which teams and positions had the best 3 point percentages so that opposing teams could plan on defending the high efficent 3 point teams. I also wanted to see which players were best in points, assists and total rebounds by position. I also provide insights into which players scored the most and by which team. This was a really fun project as I love sports and always want to find interesting insights from the data.
